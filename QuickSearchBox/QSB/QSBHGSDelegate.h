// The path presentation shown in the search results window can be
// built from one of the following (in order of preference):
//   1. an array of cell descriptions
//   2. a file path URL (from our |identifier|).
//   3. a slash-delimeted string of cell titles
// Only the first option guarantees that a cell is clickable, the
// second option may but is not likely to support clicking, and the
// third definitely not.  We will return a decent cell array for regular URLs 
// and file URLs and a mediocre one for public.message results but you can 
// compose and provide your own in your source's provideValueForKey: method.
