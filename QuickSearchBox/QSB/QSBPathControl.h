// This is a hack.  For some as-yet-undiagnosed reason, the path
// control's parent class, NSControl, in response to a path cell
// click, causes a bindings update _before_ dispatching the
// action to the target.
// WARNING: Only use this class in conjunction with
// QSBPathCell otherwise you will go blind.
// TODO(mrossetti): Figure out why this is required and fix it.
