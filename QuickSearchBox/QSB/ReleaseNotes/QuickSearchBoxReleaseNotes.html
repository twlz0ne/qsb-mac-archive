      Issues <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=296">
      296</a>, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=298">
      298</a> and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=299">
      299</a>: Fixed a variety of issues introduced by recent changes to 
      account handling including the losing the default button, text 
      disappearing in the edit fields, account information being retained 
      though invalid.  Also fixed tabbing through fields in Google account
      setup and added some animation when captcha is required to smooth
      out the presentation.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=263">
        Issue 263</a>: Fixed runaway thread count when Spotlight is
        manually disabled.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=193">
        Issue 193</a> and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=253">
        Issue 253</a>: Added a Trash plugin. Search for &quot;Trash&quot; to list the
        contents of the Trash for all mounted volumes, or use the &quot;Move to
        Trash&quot; to quickly move files and folders to the Trash.
    </li>
    <li>
        Added a SMB/AFP Sharing plugin. Search for &quot;Mount&quot; to get
        a list of nearby file shares, or type in the name of a specific
        share. Select the share and hit Return to mount the share.
    </li>
    <li>
        Fixed an exception thrown by the ChatBuddiesSource where an IMBuddy 
        result contains an NSNull for the first and/or last name fields
        by only using those names if they are actually NSStrings.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=18">
        Issue 18</a>: Google Apps accounts (AKA 'hosted') are now supported.
        When setting up a Google account, the user name is monitored as it
        is being entered and if its domain does not match "gmail.com" then
        a checkbox is presented ("This is a Google Apps account.") which,
        when checked, will set up a hosted account.  The "gmail.com" domain
        matching string can be localized using the string "@gmail.com".
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=76">
        Issue 76</a>: The 'More' line in the top results now presents the
        singular form of a category name if there is only 1 result for
        that category.
