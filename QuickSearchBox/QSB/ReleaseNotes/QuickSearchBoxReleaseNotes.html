      <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=354">

      Matching performance (especially on regularly used items) should be
      noticeably faster. Also, cut down on useless redraw.

        A couple of checkboxes in preferences had their scaling turned on
        which was presenting warnings.  The scaling was unnecessary and was
        removed.

    <li>
       <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=483">
        Issue 483</a>: At startup, the search window was always being
        re-centered on the screen.  This has been changed to restore the
        previous position and then perform a sanity check to insure the
        window is completely visible.

    <li>
       <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=564">
        Issue 564</a>: Some garbage could be seen in the descriptive text
        shown for More results because the descriptive string contained
        more than one line of text.  This is no longer necessary
        since only one line of description is now shown,  so we retreive and
        present only the single line of descriptive text.  Also enhanced the
        tool tip for More results by presenting a URL when available.

    <li>
       <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=533">

        are now properly selected during autocompletion.
