      Fixed up issue where Actions and Contacts were not being added to the
      shortcuts.
    </li>
    <li>
      Issues <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=296">
      296</a>, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=298">
      298</a> and 
      <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=299">299</a>: 
      Fixed a variety of issues introduced by recent changes to 
      account handling including the losing the default button, text 
      disappearing in the edit fields, account information being retained 
      though invalid.  Also fixed tabbing through fields in Google account
      setup and added some animation when captcha is required to smooth
      out the presentation.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=263">

        Issue 193</a> and 
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=253">
        Issue 253</a>: Added a Trash plugin. Search for &quot;Trash&quot; to 
        list the contents of the Trash for all mounted volumes, or use the 
        &quot;Move to Trash&quot; to quickly move files and folders to the 
        Trash.
    </li>
    <li>
        Added a SMB/AFP Sharing plugin. Search for &quot;Mount&quot; to get
        a list of nearby file shares, or type in the name of a specific
        share. Select the share and hit Return to mount the share.
    </li>
    <li>
        Fixed an exception thrown by the ChatBuddiesSource where an IMBuddy 
        result contains an NSNull for the first and/or last name fields
        by only using those names if they are actually NSStrings.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=18">
        Issue 18</a>: Google Apps accounts (AKA 'hosted') are now supported.
        When setting up a Google account, the user name is monitored as it
        is being entered and if its domain does not match "gmail.com" then
        a checkbox is presented ("This is a Google Apps account.") which,
        when checked, will set up a hosted account.  The "gmail.com" domain
        matching string can be localized using the string "@gmail.com".
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=76">
        Issue 76</a>: The 'More' line in the top results now presents the

    <li>
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=362">
        Issue 362</a>: Fixed a problem where photos without a caption were
        coming up without any description at all in 'More' and with a blank
        top line in 'Top' results by substituting the picture title (often
        the picture's file name).   Added a Picasaweb-specific placeholder
        icon.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=365">
        Issue 365</a>: A Google Bookmarks searchable item is no longer added
        for Google hosted accounts since hosted accounts do not support
        Bookmarks.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=360">
        Issue 360</a>: Fixed a problem where if More is showing and the
        user clears the query (i.e. presses &lt;esc&gt;) then Top is
        presented but with a blank results window and a spinning progress
        indicator.
    </li>
    <li>
        Enhanced the debug log message emitted by the Developer Documentation
        search source when one of the documentation sets cannot be found
        such that the message indicates <i>which</i> of the developer 
        documentation sets could not be found and opened.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=129">

    <li>
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=274">
        Issue 274</a>: Fixed a bug that would cause iTunes related actions
        (e.g., 'Add to Party Shuffle') to show up for applications other
        than iTunes.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=307">

        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=7">

        deals reasonably well with matching camelcase. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Added the concept of an account type extension and updated the
        GoogleAccount and Twitter plugins.  The user interface elements
        of setting up and editing accounts has been migrated out of
        Vermilion and into QSB since it's the client's responsibility to
        provide the user interface.  See QSBEditAccountWindowController.h,
        QSBSetUpAccountViewController.h and HGSAccountTypesExtensionPoint.h.
    </li>

        Updated presentation of Google Docs results:

          <li TYPE=square>
            Added a snippet line for Google Docs results showing from which
            account the result came, which is helpful for situations where
            multiple Google accounts have been set up.
          </li>
          <li TYPE=square>
            Enhanced the docs result tooltip to show the account.

        account' checkbox was not being reset after the account domain
        was changed back to a non-hosted domain (such as 'gmail.com').
    </li>
    <li>

        Issue 406</a>: The user interface functions necessary to support
