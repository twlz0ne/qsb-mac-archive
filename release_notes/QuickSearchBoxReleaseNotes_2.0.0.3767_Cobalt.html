  <p>
    Thank you for working with QSB and giving us so much encouragement and
   feedback. We really appreciate it.
  </p>
  <p>
   Here is the long awaited next beta. Hopefully you find it has been
   worth the wait. A handful of the many, many issues we have fixed are listed below,
   but some of the big highlights are:
   <ul>
     <li>
       Fixed HotKey activation bug from last beta. Sorry about that.
     </li>
     <li>
       Fully 64 bit.
     </li>
     <li>
       Support for Move To.. and Open With.. and other more complex actions.
     </li>
     <li>
       Support for searching Google Calendars.
     </li>
     <li>
       Faster Spotlight searches.
     </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
   You will also notice the branding has changed significantly. We are moving
   from being a Google project, to a fully open sourced project. This means that
   we will are now soliciting external developers. If you are interested in
   helping out, please join the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/qsb-mac-dev">
    http://groups.google.com/group/qsb-mac-dev</a> mailing list and get in touch.
   </p>
   <p>
   You will also notice that some features have been removed (the big one
   being the Twitter plugin) but fear not. These have been moved to our
   plugins page. You can find them here
   <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac-plugins/">
   http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac-plugins/</a>. You may find some new
   functionality that you didn't know existed.
   </p>
   <p>
   This is still a beta, so please file issues on any bugs you see.

      state until we are ready.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=354">
        Issue 354</a>: You can now assign a function key to QSB. Thanks to
        spleaner for supplying a patch for this issue.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=518">
        Issue 518</a>: You can now assign control-tab as hotkey for QSB.
    </li>
    <li>
      Matching performance (especially on regularly used items) should be

    </li>
    <li>
       <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=515">
        Issue 515</a>: Play songs in iTunes in non-English locales should now

    </li>
    <li>
        A couple of checkboxes in preferences had their scaling turned on
        which was presenting warnings at compile time.
        The scaling was unnecessary and was removed.
    </li>
    <li>
       <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=483">
        Issue 483</a>: At startup, the search window was always being
        re-centered on the screen.  This has been changed to restore the
        previous position and then perform a sanity check to insure the
        window is completely visible.
    </li>
    <li>
       <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=564">
        Issue 564</a>: Some garbage could be seen in the descriptive text
        shown for More results because the descriptive string contained
        more than one line of text.  This is no longer necessary
        since only one line of description is now shown,  so we retreive and
        present only the single line of descriptive text.  Also enhanced the
        tool tip for More results by presenting a URL when available.
    </li>
    <li>
       <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=533">

    </li>
    <li>
       <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=502">
        Issue 502</a>: When looking for the double command key tap we now ignore
        it if there is a mouse down or up during the taps. Makes cmd-clicking
        things much easier.
    </li>
    <li>
       <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=531">
        Issue 531</a>: Phone numbers now get a "1" country code stuck on them
        if necessary to make them work with Skype.
    </li>
    <li>
       <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=561">
        Issue 561</a>: Contacts now show street addresses as one of their
        fields.

    <li>
       <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=562">
        Issue 562</a>: The default action for a street address is to display
        it in Google Maps.
    </li>
    <li>
       Startup now has a "progress indicator" of sorts. Our window appears
       much faster at startup so there isn't any "hang" after launch.
    </li>
    <li>
       <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=567">
        Issue 567</a>: Right after launching, some shortcuts could be missing
        critical information required for performing certain actions,
        particularly for sources that may take some time to refresh their
        results.  To fix this, added -[HGSSearchSource archiveKeys] function
        which allows sources to provide additional information to be cached
        for a result.  This information could still become stale if the
        source changes while QSB is not running, but that's a different
        problem.
    </li>
    <li>
       <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=350">
        Issue 350</a>: We now keep track of what space (as in spaces and expose)
        the user is currently in, and display the preferences on that space
        instead of jumping to the first space that they opened the preferences
        panel on.

        Issue 540</a> and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=600">
        Issue 600</a>: The positioning of the results in relation to the search
        box should be much better now.  There was a cycle of window size
        adjustments occurring which has been eliminated.
    </li>
    <li>
      Added a new python search source for retrieving stock data, given a
      stock ticker called StockQuoter.  This plugin also demonstrates the
      use of custom results views.  See the comments in
      QSBResultRowViewController.m and take a look at the implementation
      of StockQuoterViewController.h/.m.

        Issue 495</a>: The search box can now be moved closer to the edges
        of the screen, the movement of the window has been improved significantly
        when the results panel is presented, and the result window is kept
        better aligned with the search box.

    <li>
       <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=503">

      results types that otherwise would be allowed (by
      "kHGSActionDirectObjectTypesKey"). This could be used, for example,
      by actions that would normally allow <i>all</i> results ("*") but
      which want to exclude one or more specific types (such as
      "webpage" types and all of its subtypes).

      Added actions for uploading to Google Docs. Files which can be
      converted to a Google Doc (text, PDF, CSV, etc.) are uploaded for any
      account type. Files can also be uploaded to Google Docs as-is for certain
      accounts. Image files (specifically image/png, image/gif and image/jpeg)
      can be uploaded and then converted by OCR (optical character recognition)
      into textual Google Docs.

    <li>
      Added a Google Calendars search source. A search term of "calendar" will
      present a list of all 'owned' calendars for all Google accounts for which
      the Google Calendar search source has been enabled. Pivoting on a
      particular calendar will present all events for the current day for
      that calendar.
