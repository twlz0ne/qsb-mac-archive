<h3>Important Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>
This version of QSB is going to reset your plugin preferences and account 
preferences. You will have to go to the preferences panel and re-enter your 
account information to use any features that depend upon accounts such as 
PicasaWeb search, Google Docs search or Twitter.
</li>
<li>
This version of QSB will break any third party plugins until they are
upgraded to work with it. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, 
however we are still attempting to stabilize the plugin APIs and they probably 
won't be set in stone until the 1.0 release.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Enhancements in this version</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        HGSSimpleAccount supports authentication remediation.  See <code>
        -[HGSSimpleAccountEditController canGiveUserAnotherTry]</code> and
        <code>-[HGSSetUpSimpleAccountViewController
        canGiveUserAnotherTryOffWindow:]</code> and the captcha implementation
        in <code>GoogleAccount</code> for an example.
    </li>
    <li>
        Extensions don't really know if they have an UI available, so 
        we've added support for extensions to notify the client (QSB, in
        this case) of short messages to be presented to the user.  This 
        is done via <code>kHGSUserMessageNotification</code>.  Details 
        can be fond in <code>HGSExtension.h</code> and an example can 
        be seen in <code>TwitterMessageAction.m</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Added QSBUserMessage.h/.m which does the user notification
        presentation mentioned in the previous item.  A small gray status
        window is presented over the query window for a few seconds.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=118">
        Issue 118</a>: The path presentation shown at the bottom of the 
        results window for the currently selected result was being overdrawn.
        This has been fixed.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=34">
        Issue 34</a> and
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=50">
        issue 50</a>: The Google Bookmarks source now uses Google Accounts.
        An instance of Google Bookmarks for each Google account that has been
        set up will appear in the Searchable Items list in preferences.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=198">
        Issue 198</a> and
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=211">
        issue 211</a>: Fixed a problem in the SharedFileList search source
        where changing the name of or moving a recently used file would
        cause erroneous results to appear for the item.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=179">
        Issue 179</a>: Fixed a off-by-one error in identifying word boundaries
        that caused a crash when typing multiple words in the search box.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=140">
        Issue 140</a>: Fixed a problem where pressing down-arrow in an
        empty search box would show an empty result box. Recognize
        that there are no results to show and suppress the result
        window presentation.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=187">
        Issue 187</a>: Fixed a problem where pressing right-arrow after
        pivoting on a result would refuse to drill in because the old
        completion text range was competing with the pivot.
    </li>
		<li>
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=135">
        Issue 135</a>: Text input now has large type as a default action
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=146">
        Issue 145</a>: Added support throughout QSB for arrays of results. 
        All actions were overhauled to handle arrays of results. You can't use
        the comma operator just yet, but you can get multiple items via
        selections in the Finder, and choosing "cmd-G" in QSB. The interface
        to actions has changed considerably. Third parties will need to update
        their actions appropriately.
    </li>
    <li>
        Cleaned up naming throughout internal API. Third parties will need to
        update their code. HGSObject -> HGSResult is the main one, but several
        methods had their names changed as well.
    </li>
    <li>
        Added "path for file URL" command to AppleScript dictionary allowing
        you to get the path of a file url.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=131">
        Issue 131</a>: Fixed up image AppleScript plugins so you can now
        rotate, scale and convert images.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=134">
        Issue 134</a>: Lots of text typed into the search box no longer
        shifts left and right.  The search box was valiantly trying to show
        intermittent but inappropriate text completions.
    </li>
    <li>
        Standardized on a new JSON framework that fixes a potential crasher if
        we were passed a badly formatted JSON string. It is available as a
        framework for plugins to link to. Thanks to Stig Brautaset for 
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/json-framework/">JSON.framework</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Improved memory usage once again, cleaning up a couple of leaks and
        reducing startup memory usage by about 10%.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=10">
        Issue 10</a>: QSB should now position itself correctly in the Finder. 
        We have set all the appropriate flags, so if it isn't working, chances
        are it's a Finder bug.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=229">
        Issue 229</a>: User messages can now be shown via Growl, which is
        the default.  A <b>Use Growl for user messages</b> checkbox has been
        added to the <b>General</b> panel of preferences for controlling
        the use of Growl.  A plugin can optionally add descriptive text
        to the user message notification.  This will be shown as a second
        line when presented to the user.
    </li>
    <li>
        Fixed a problem where right-arrowing from the top-most result was
        not pivoting on the result.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=200">
        Issue 200</a>: Previously, some results were always shown below-the-fold
        (mostly actions) regardless of how much room was available in the top
        results.  This has been changed so that as many of the below-the-fold
        results as possible will be shown in the available space in the top
        results, respecting the user's <b>Number of results</b> preference.
        This means that more actions will be available when pivoting. 
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=221">
        Issue 221</a>: Now adds "from Google Quick Search Box (Mac)" to
        tweets. 
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=238">
        Issue 238</a>: Icon fetch operations that complete needed to be
        removed from the list of pending fetch operations.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=222">
        Issue 222</a>: When the preference window is shown a validation is
        done on all accounts so that account status is up-to-date.  Whenever
        a search source experiences what may be an authentication issue it
        has the account do an authentication so that the preferences are
        updated immediately. 
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=273">
        Issue 273</a>: Changed sending of Twitter messages to be asynchronous.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=281">
        Issue 281</a>: If a search source relies on an account that fails
        to authenticate at startup then it is still shown in the Searchable
        Items list but is disabled.  Once the account problem is fixed the
        search source will be available once again.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=283">
        Issue 283</a>: Whenever Google Bookmarks or Twitter gets a credential
        challenge the account is immediately authenticated and an error is
        reported if there is an authentication failure.
    </li>
    <li>
        Added a plugin API version check when starting up QSB. QSB plugins must
        have a 'HGSPluginAPIVersion' key in their plists with a value of '2'.
        We have made extensive changes to the API and didn't want non-conformant
        plugins to crash on launch.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=270">

        pop-down menu.

        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=268">
        Issue 268</a>: Icons should now show up correctly for AppleScript 
        actions. Thanks to Aaron Ecay for the patch.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Picasaweb search source will now suggest to the user that they
        may need to enable Picasa for their Google account whenever the
        server reports a '404 - Not found'.
    </li>
    <li>
        Issues <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=215">
        215</a>, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=245">
        245</a>, and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=249">
        249</a>: Account setup and editing has been improved.  Validation is
        performed for all accounts whenever the Preferences window is shown.
    </li>

        temperatures. Thanks to Christian Savard for the patch.

    <li>
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=127">
        Issue 127</a>: A plugin that provides a system dictionary search source
        has been added to the distribution, returning defintions for words
        typed into QSB and direct access to definitions in the Dictionary
        application.
    </li>
    <li>
        ApplicationUI source is now on by default. You must "Enable access for 
        assistive devices" in the "Universal Access" system preference for it 
        to work.
