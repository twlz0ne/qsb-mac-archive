      Calculator results now copy and paste correctly.
    </li>
    <li>
        Added GoogleDocsSaveAsActions which allow docs to be save to a local
        file.  Spreadsheets are also supported as of the fix to
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=595">
        Issue 595</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=52">
        Issue 52</a>: We now show the QSB immediately on launch in a disabled 
      state until we are ready.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=354">
        Issue 354</a>: You can now assign a function key to QSB. Thanks to
        spleaner for supplying a patch for this issue.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=518">
        Issue 518</a>: You can now assign control-tab as hotkey for QSB.
    </li>
    <li>
      Matching performance (especially on regularly used items) should be
      noticeably faster. Also, cut down on useless redraw.
    </li>
    <li>
       <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=515">
        Issue 515</a>: Play songs in iTunes in non-English locales should now 
        work. Thanks to Philipp Comans for isolating this issue.
    </li>
    <li>
        A couple of checkboxes in preferences had their scaling turned on
        which was presenting warnings at compile time.
        The scaling was unnecessary and was removed.
    </li>
    <li>
       <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=483">
        Issue 483</a>: At startup, the search window was always being
        re-centered on the screen.  This has been changed to restore the
        previous position and then perform a sanity check to insure the
        window is completely visible.
    </li>
    <li>
       <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=564">
        Issue 564</a>: Some garbage could be seen in the descriptive text
        shown for More results because the descriptive string contained
        more than one line of text.  This is no longer necessary
        since only one line of description is now shown,  so we retreive and
        present only the single line of descriptive text.  Also enhanced the
        tool tip for More results by presenting a URL when available.
    </li>
    <li>
       <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=533">
        Issue 533</a>: Accented characters and other composed characters
        are now properly selected during autocompletion.
    </li>
    <li>
       <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=570">
        Issue 570</a>: Eliminated warnings when compiling .xib files.
    </li>
    <li>
       <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=481">
        Issue 481</a>: We no longer show up at startup if we are a startup item.
    </li>
    <li>
       <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=502">
        Issue 502</a>: When looking for the double command key tap we now ignore 
        it if there is a mouse down or up during the taps. Makes cmd-clicking 
        things much easier.
    </li>
    <li>
       <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=531">
        Issue 531</a>: Phone numbers now get a "1" country code stuck on them 
        if necessary to make them work with Skype.
    </li>
    <li>
       <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=561">
        Issue 561</a>: Contacts now show street addresses as one of their 
        fields.
    </li>
    <li>
       <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=562">
        Issue 562</a>: The default action for a street address is to display 
        it in Google Maps.
    </li>
    <li>
       Startup now has a "progress indicator" of sorts. Our window appears 
       much faster at startup so there isn't any "hang" after launch.
    </li>
    <li>
       <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=567">
        Issue 567</a>: Right after launching, some shortcuts could be missing
        critical information required for performing certain actions, 
        particularly for sources that may take some time to refresh their
        results.  To fix this, added -[HGSSearchSource archiveKeys] function
        which allows sources to provide additional information to be cached
        for a result.  This information could still become stale if the
        source changes while QSB is not running, but that's a different
        problem.
    </li>
    <li>
       <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=350">
        Issue 350</a>: We now keep track of what space (as in spaces and expose) 
        the user is currently in, and display the preferences on that space 
        instead of jumping to the first space that they opened the preferences 
        panel on.
    </li>
    <li>
       <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=597">
        Issue 597</a>: Darkened the selection to make it easier to discern.
    </li>
    <li>
       <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=540">
        Issue 540</a> and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=600">
        Issue 600</a>: The positioning of the results in relation to the search
        box should be much better now.  There was a cycle of window size
        adjustments occurring which has been eliminated.
    </li>
    <li>
      Added a new python search source for retrieving stock data, given a
      stock ticker called StockQuoter.  This plugin also demonstrates the
      use of custom results views.  See the comments in
      QSBResultRowViewController.m and take a look at the implementation
      of StockQuoterViewController.h/.m.

        Issue 540</a> and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=495">
        Issue 495</a>: The search box can now be moved closer to the edges
        of the screen, the movement of the window has been improved significantly
        when the results panel is presented, and the result window is kept 
        better aligned with the search box.
    </li>
    <li>
       <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/issues/detail?id=503">
        Issue 503</a>: Enhanced the reporting of authentication issues

      Shortcuts for items that no longer exist are now removed from the
      shortcuts database.
    </li>
