Oompa, Loompa, doom-pa-dee-do 
I have a perfect puzzle for you 
Oompa, Loompa, doom-pa-dee-dee 
If you are wise, you'll listen to me 

What do you get when you guzzle down sweets? 
Eating as much as an elephant eats 
What are you at getting terribly fat? 
What do you think will come of that? 

I don't like the look of it 

Oompa, Loompa, doom-pa-dee-da 
If you're not greedy, you will go far 
You will live in happiness too 
Like the Oompa Loompa doom-pa-dee-do

Gum chewing's fine when it's once in a while 
It stops you from smoking and brightens your smile 
But it's repulsive, revolting, and wrong 
Chewing and chewing all day long 

The way that a cow does 

Oompa, Loompa, doom-pa-dee-da 
Given good manners, you will go far 
You will live in happiness too 
Like the Oompa Loompa doom-pa-dee-do 

Oompa, Loompa, doom-pa-dee-do

Who do you blame when your kid is a brat? 
Pampered and spoiled like a Siamese cat 
Blaming the kids is a lie and a shame 
You know exactly who's to blame 

The mother and the father 

Oompa, Loompa, doom-pa-dee-da 
If you're not spoiled, then you will go far 
You will live in happiness too 
Like the Oompa Loompa doom-pa-dee-do 

Oompa, Loompa, doom-pa-dee-do

What do you get from a glut of TV? 
A pain in the neck and an IQ of three 
Why don't you try simply reading a book? 
Or can you just not bear to look? 

You'll get no...you'll get no...you'll get no commercials 

Oompa, Loompa, doom-pa-dee-da 
If you're not greedy, you will go far 
You will live in happiness too 
Like the Oompa Loompa doom-pa-dee-do
